    If you're lucky enough to live in a bike share city, but aren't a bike-sharer, you've probablly had and encounter with one. Since the inception of Fords Gobike in SF around 2017, the sprawling docking stations periodically buzz with helmeted urbanites launching into the streets and sidewalks,l on their way to.. where, excactly?
    Although I am 'bike person,' with a bike or two of my own-- for the last few years I have driven an electric minivan -l elementary school kids on an infite loop of pickup drop-off, pickup again. I have more in common with the Muni driver than the average bike sharer. 
     I just don't align with the bikeshare model. But I've often wondered while dodging or swerving , *'whither goest thou, boosted biker? And whence returnst thou in the eve?'*
The answer to these musings were the lofty goals at the outset of my investigation of the [Bay Wheels data set](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data)
